# Web_Dev_BootCamp_2024

This is a Udemy course by Colt Steele which covers major web dev topics including html, css, JavaScript, APIs, Databases, and more! 

My goal is to learn as much about web dev that I can from this course, then go on to work on a personal project that will showcase my new skills as well as continue to discover more about the world of web development.
